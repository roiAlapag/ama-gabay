# GROUP AMA - web app prototype for GABAY

## Description

<div style="text-align: justify">
We designed our application minimalistic, easy to use/user-friendly to first-time users, and appealing to the eye. Our application offers a website where users can create an appointment to small clinics to help them with common disease problems like flu. This would reduce the risk of going to hospitals where most people with serious diseases are admitted, including COVID patients. Also, the app has an additional feature which they can search about common diseases, know the symptoms, and what they can do to alleviate or solve the problem. We also offer three options; online, at the clinic, or in your home where the doctor will go to your house method in appointment check-ups to cater their needs and comfortability to safeness.

In our web application, you will see different interfaces depending on their roles. The following are unregistered users, registered users as patients and doctors, and lastly, the admin.

The users that are registered as doctors can check their schedules and view the patients and their own profiles. The doctors can also rate their patients depending on their behaviors.

## Prototype for unregistered and registered client/patients

This link [Figma - Unregistered/registered client Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/roc86Np8e0an1xkdb0tPPK/web-idea?node-id=155%3A309&starting-point-node-id=155%3A309) 

_Unregistered_

The only benefit to an unregistered user is they can explore our website and search for common diseases. The users can have information about the symptoms of the disease they have search and learn how they can apply first aid treatment. The disadvantage is that they cannot set an appointment. If they are an unregistered, we would require them to create an account.


_Registered as patient_

When a user has registered as a patient, they can create an appointment by clicking the first one. This will direct them to a fill-up form to process the appointment. Also, these users can also use the search feature on the diseases, symptoms, and first-aid treatment. Patients can view the profiles of the doctors and can later on rate them after their performance.

## Prototype for admin side

This link [Figma - Admin Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/roc86Np8e0an1xkdb0tPPK/web-idea?node-id=155%3A309&starting-point-node-id=155%3A309) 

_Admin_

![admin](/images/admin.png)

The admin accounts have an access to the list accounts of patients and doctors.  Admin can also use the search for the disease feature just like the others registered and unregistered accounts. In addition, they can view the reported accounts of doctors and patients.

## Design Idea

The user interface design has a blue and white color scheme which gives off a simple but formal feeling, which we believe is appropriate for our main concept for a medical web application. We also made use of other colors such as light green and black to add more variety to the color palette. We chose this particular set of colors because it is a perfect fit for medical-related applications. The color combination of blue and white is typically associated with trust, knowledge, credibility, professionalism, cleanliness and calmness. When we think of something related to the field of medicine, these are the colors which come to our mind first.

In addition, the interface is smooth between the web pages which allows users to access information easily. The buttons such as this icon, is functional and redirects users to the linked webpage. The buttons allow the users to navigate through the home screen, view doctor profiles, set for appointments and view other functions of the web application.

The logo of our web application shown below also exhibits the main theme and concept of our web app. It has two hands, which signifies a helping hand from the rightmost (representing the medical healthcare providers) while the leftmost hand represents the users who are the patients.

Moreover, the design of the Web Application is consistent all throughout the web pages. It maintains the userâ€™s eye and attention since the texts are readable and center-aligned. It maintains proper alignment in its pages.
